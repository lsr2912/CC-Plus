Version 0.2 : Released 15/Feb/2018
  * Alerts subsystem and accompanying automation only halfway built
  * Manual ingest process may still be buggy, and could also use a batch/mutliple-report
    option to allow for wholesale ingest of month(s),  institution(s), or provider(s). This
    means a queue and queue-handling page(s), but wasn't scoped for the intial project.
  * The JR5 report schema extending code (to add columns as future YOP-#### data comes in
    for future years) is suspect. Did manually in January, but code needs further testing.
